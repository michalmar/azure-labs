# Hands-on-Lab AML & R

This is a set of minilabs walking through basics of using R in Azure.

##  Data Science Virtual Machine lab
In this lab you will provision Data Science Virtual Machine, a comprehensive pre-configured virtual machines for data science modelling, development and deployment.

Go to: [01 Data Science Virtual Machine lab](./01-dsvm-lab.md)

## Use R in Azure

In this lab you will use Azure Data Science Virtual Machine to access presintalled and preconfigured RStudio. And run simple training of logistic regression in the Azure VM. 

Go to: [02 Use R in Azure](./02-use-plain-R.md)


## Use AML SDK for R in Azure

In this lab you will continue to work with R modelling with Logistic Regression but this time using Azure Machine Learning.
