The Azure ML SDK provides a set of logging APIs for logging various metrics during training runs. These metrics are recorded and persisted in the experiment run record. The metrics can then be accessed at any time or viewed in the run details page in [Azure Machine Learning studio](http://ml.azure.com). See the [reference](https://azure.github.io/azureml-sdk-for-r/reference/index.html#section-training-experimentation) for the full set of logging methods `log_*()`.\n",

During training, files written to `./outputs` are automatically uploaded to your run record by Azure ML and persisted as artifacts.

The default Docker image built for training already contains the three packages (`caret`, `e1071`, and `optparse`) needed in the training script.  So you don't need to specify additional information. If you are using R packages that are not included by default, use the estimator's `cran_packages` parameter to add additional CRAN packages.
