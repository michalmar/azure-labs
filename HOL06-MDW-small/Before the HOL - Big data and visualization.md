   - **Version**: Select **V2**

   - **Location**: Select any region close to you.

   - **Enable GIT**: **Unchecked**

   **_Understanding Data Factory Location:_**
   The Data Factory location is where the metadata of the data factory is stored and where the triggering of the pipeline is initiated from. Meanwhile, a data factory can access data stores and compute services in other Azure regions to move data between data stores or process data using compute services. This behavior is realized through the [globally available IR](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/?products=data-factory) to ensure data compliance, efficiency, and reduced network egress costs.

   The IR Location defines the location of its back-end compute, and essentially the location where the data movement, activity dispatching, and SSIS package execution are performed. The IR location can be different from the location of the data factory it belongs to.

   ![The Azure Data Factory creation form is populated with the values as outlined above.](media/azure-data-factory-create-blade.png)

4. Select **Create** to finish and submit.

### Task 5: Download and install Power BI Desktop

Power BI desktop is required to make a connection to your Azure Databricks environment when creating the Power BI dashboard.

1. Download and install [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).



### Task 6: Provision Azure Synapse


**Create and query a Synapse SQL pool using the Azure portal**

Quickly create and query a Synapse SQL pool (data warehouse) in Azure Synapse Analytics (formerly SQL DW) using the Azure portal.

#### Prerequisites

1. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) account before you begin.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Creating a SQL pool in Azure Synapse may result in a new billable service. For more information, see [Azure Synapse Analytics pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/synapse-analytics/).

#### Sign in to the Azure portal

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

#### Create a SQL pool

Data warehouses are created using SQL pool in Azure Synapse Analytics. A SQL pool is created with a defined set of [compute resources](memory-concurrency-limits.md). The database is created within an [Azure resource group](../../azure-resource-manager/management/overview.md?toc=/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/toc.json&bc=/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/breadcrumb/toc.json) and in a [logical SQL server](../../azure-sql/database/logical-servers.md?toc=/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/toc.json&bc=/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/breadcrumb/toc.json).

Follow these steps to create a SQL pool that contains the **AdventureWorksDW** sample data.

1. select **Create a resource** in the upper left-hand corner of the Azure portal.

   ![create a resource in Azure portal](./media/create-data-warehouse-portal/create-a-resource.png)

2. Select **Databases** on the **New** page, and select **Azure Synapse Analytics (formerly SQL DW)** in the **Featured** list.

   ![create empty data warehouse](./media/create-data-warehouse-portal/create-a-data-warehouse.png)

3. In **Basics**, provide your subscription, resource group, SQL pool name, and server name:

   | Setting | Suggested value | Descriptionâ¯|
   | :------ | :-------------- | :---------- |
   | **Subscription** | Your subscription | For details about your subscriptions, see [Subscriptions](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions). |
   | **Resource group** | myResourceGroup | For valid resource group names, see [Naming rules and restrictions](/azure/architecture/best-practices/resource-naming?toc=/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/toc.json&bc=/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/breadcrumb/toc.json). |
   | **SQL pool name** | Any globally unique name  (An example is *mySampleDataWarehouse*) | For valid database names, see [Database Identifiers](/sql/relational-databases/databases/database-identifiers?toc=/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/toc.json&bc=/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/breadcrumb/toc.json&view=azure-sqldw-latest). Note, a SQL pool is one type of database. |
   | **Server** | Any globally unique name | Select existing server, or create a new server name, select **Create new**. For valid server names, see [Naming rules and restrictions](/azure/architecture/best-practices/resource-naming?toc=/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/toc.json&bc=/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/breadcrumb/toc.json). |

   ![create a data warehouse basic details](./media/create-data-warehouse-portal/create-sql-pool-basics.png)

4. Under **Performance level**, select **Select performance level** to optionally change your configuration with a slider. For the workshop DW200 is sufficient.

   ![change data warehouse performance level](./media/create-data-warehouse-portal/create-sql-pool-performance-level.png)  

   For more information about performance levels, see [Manage compute in Azure Synapse Analytics](sql-data-warehouse-manage-compute-overview.md).

5. Select **Additional Settings**, under **Use existing data**, choose **Sample** so that AdventureWorksDW will be created as the sample database.

    ![select Use existing data](./media/create-data-warehouse-portal/create-sql-pool-additional-1.png) 

6. Now that you've completed the Basics tab of the Azure Synapse Analytics form, select **Review + Create** and then **Create** to create the SQL pool. Provisioning takes a few minutes.

   ![select Review + Create](./media/create-data-warehouse-portal/create-sql-pool-review-create.png)

   ![select create](./media/create-data-warehouse-portal/create-sql-pool-create.png)

7. On the toolbar, select **Notifications** to monitor the deployment process.

   ![notification](./media/create-data-warehouse-portal/notification.png)

#### Create a server-level firewall rule

The Azure Synapse service creates a firewall at the server-level. This firewall prevents external applications and tools from connecting to the server or any databases on the server. To enable connectivity, you can add firewall rules that enable connectivity for specific IP addresses. Follow these steps to create a [server-level firewall rule](../../azure-sql/database/firewall-configure.md?toc=/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/toc.json&bc=/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/breadcrumb/toc.json) for your client's IP address.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Synapse communicates over port 1433. If you are trying to connect from within a corporate network, outbound traffic over port 1433 might not be allowed by your network's firewall. If so, you cannot connect to your server unless your IT department opens port 1433.

1. After the deployment completes, select **All services** from the left-hand menu. Select **Databases**, select the star next to **Azure Synapse Analytics** to add Azure Synapse Analytics to your favorites.

2. Select **Azure Synapse Analytics** from the left-hand menu and then select **mySampleDataWarehouse** on the **Azure Synapse Analytics** page. The overview page for your database opens, showing you the fully qualified server name (such as **sqlpoolservername.database.windows.net**) and provides options for further configuration.

3. Copy this fully qualified server name for use to connect to your server and its databases in this and other quick starts. To open server settings, select the server name.

   ![find server name](./media/create-data-warehouse-portal/find-server-name.png)

4. Select **Show firewall settings**.

   ![server settings](./media/create-data-warehouse-portal/server-settings.png)

5. The **Firewall settings** page for the server opens.

   ![server firewall rule](./media/create-data-warehouse-portal/server-firewall-rule.png)

6. To add your current IP address to a new firewall rule, select **Add client IP** on the toolbar. A firewall rule can open port 1433 for a single IP address or a range of IP addresses.

7. select **Save**. A server-level firewall rule is created for your current IP address opening port 1433 on the server.

8. select **OK** and then close the **Firewall settings** page.

You can now connect to the server and its SQL pools using this IP address. The connection works from SQL Server Management Studio or another tool of your choice. When you connect, use the ServerAdmin account you created previously.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By default, access through the SQL Database firewall is enabled for all Azure services. select **OFF** on this page and then select **Save** to disable the firewall for all Azure services.


#### Get the fully qualified server name

Get the fully qualified server name for your server in the Azure portal. Later you use the fully qualified name when connecting to the server.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2. Select **Azure Synapse Analytics** from the left-hand menu, and select your  on the **Azure Synapse Analytics** page.

3. In the **Essentials** pane in the Azure portal page for your database, locate and then copy the **Server name**. In this example, the fully qualified name is sqlpoolservername.database.windows.net.

    ![connection information](./media/create-data-warehouse-portal/find-server-name-copy.png)

You should follow all these steps provided _before_ attending the Hands-on lab.
