# MLOps hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will learn how Trey Research can leverage Deep Learning technologies to scan through their vehicle specification documents to find compliance issues with new regulations. You will standardize the model format to ONNX and observe how this simplifies inference runtime code, enabling pluggability of different models and targeting a broad range of runtime environments, and most importantly, improves inferencing speed over the native model. You will build a DevOps pipeline to coordinate retrieving the latest best model from the model registry, packaging the web application, deploying the web application, and inferencing web service. After a first successful deployment, you will make updates to both the model, the and web application, and execute the pipeline once to achieve an updated deployment. You will also learn how to monitor the model's performance after it is deployed, so Trey Research can be proactive with performance issues.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to implement end-to-end solutions that fully operationalize deep learning models, inclusive of all application components that depend on the model.

## Overview

Trey Research Inc. delivers innovative solutions for manufacturers. They specialize in identifying and solving problems for manufacturers that can run the range from automating away mundane but time-intensive processes to delivering cutting edge approaches that provide new opportunities for their manufacturing clients. Trey Research has decades specializing in data science and application development that until now were separate units. They have seen the value created by the ad-hoc synergies between data science and app development, but they would like to unlock the greater, long term value as they formalize their approach by combining the two units into one, and follow one standardized process for operationalizing their innovations.

As their first effort of this combined initiative, they would like to define a process for operationalizing deep learning that encompasses all phases of the application life cycle along with model creation and deployment of a deep learning model. For this first proof of concept (PoC), they would like to focus on component compliance. Specifically, they are looking to leverage Deep Learning technologies with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to scan through vehicle specification documents to find compliance issues with new regulations. Even though this first scenario is focused on vehicle components, they believe this approach will generalize to any scenario involving an inventory of components, which all of their manufacturing customers deal with. The component descriptions, which are free form text, are entered and managed via a web application. This web application will take new component descriptions entered by authorized technicians and label the component as compliant or non-compliant, based on the text.

They want to ensure the overall process they create enables them to update both the underlying model and the web app in one, unified pipeline. They also want to be able to monitor the model's performance after it is deployed so they can be proactive with performance issues.

## Solution architecture

![The lab solution architecture as described by the text that follows.](media/architecture-overview.png 'Solution Architecture')

The overall approach used in this lab is to orchestrate continuous integration and continuous delivery Azure Pipelines from Azure DevOps. These pipelines are triggered by changes to artifacts that describe a machine learning pipeline, that is created with the Azure Machine Learning SDK. In the lab, you make a change to the model training script that executes the Azure Pipelines Build Pipeline, which trains the model and creates the container image. Then this triggers an Azure Pipelines Release pipeline that deploys the model as a web service to AKS, by using the Docker image that was created in the Build pipeline. Once in production, the scoring web service is monitored using a combination of Application Insights and Azure Storage.

## Requirements

1. Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.

    - Trial subscriptions will not work. You will run into issues with Azure resource quota limits.

    - Subscriptions with access limited to a single resource group will not work. You will need the ability to deploy multiple resource groups.

2. An Azure DevOps account.

## Before the hands-on lab

Refer to the [Before the hands-on lab setup guide](./Before&#32;the&#32;HOL&#32;-&#32;MLOps.md) before continuing to the lab exercises.

## Exercise 4: Setup and Run the Build Pipeline

Duration: 25 minutes

> **Note**: This exercise requires the new version of the **Pipelines** user interface. To activate it, select **Pipelines** from the left navigation. If the first option below **Pipelines** is **Builds**, you are still running on the previous version of the user interface. In this case, a popup should appear suggesting the activation of the new user interface.
>
> ![Activate the new Azure Pipelines user interface.](media/devops-ui-activation.png 'Multi-stage pipelines activation')
>
> Select **Try it!** to activate the new Pipelines user interface. When successfully activated, the first option below **Pipelines** from the left navigation will change to **Pipelines**.

### Task 1: Setup Build Pipeline

1. From left navigation select **Pipelines, Pipelines** and then select **Create pipeline**.

    ![Navigate to Pipelines, Pipelines, and then select Create pipeline](media/devops-build-pipeline-07.png 'Create Build Pipeline')

2. Select **Azure Repos Git** as your code repository.

    ![Select your code repository source for your new build pipeline.](media/devops-build-pipeline-08.png 'Repository Source')

3. Select **mlops-quickstart** as your repository.

    ![Select mlops-quickstart as your repository.](media/devops-build-pipeline-09.png 'Select Repository')

4. Review the YAML file.

    The build pipeline has four key steps:

    a. Attach folder to workspace and experiment. This command creates the `.azureml` subdirectory that contains a `config.json` file that is used to communicate with your Azure Machine Learning workspace. All subsequent steps rely on the `config.json` file to instantiate the workspace object.

    b. Create the AML Compute target to run your master pipeline for model training and model evaluation.

    c. Run the master pipeline. The master pipeline has two steps: (1) Train the machine learning model, and (2) Evaluate the trained machine learning model. The evaluation step evaluates if the new model performance is better than the currently deployed model. If the new model performance is improved, the evaluate step will create a new Image for deployment. The results of the evaluation step will be saved in a file called `eval_info.json` that will be made available for the release pipeline. You can review the code for the master pipeline and its steps in `aml_service/pipelines_master.py`,  `scripts/train.py`, and `scripts/evaluate.py`.

    d. Publish the build artifacts. The `snapshot of the repository`, `config.json`, and `eval_info.json` files are published as build artifacts and thus can be made available for the release pipeline.

    ![Review the build pipeline YAML file.](media/devops-build-pipeline-10.png 'Build pipeline YAML')

### Task 2: Run the Build Pipeline

1. Select **Run** to start running your build pipeline.

    ![Start the run for your build pipeline.](media/devops-build-pipeline-11.png 'Run Build Pipeline')

2. Monitor the build run. The build pipeline, for the first run, will take around 15 minutes to run.

    ![Monitor your build pipeline. It will take around 15 minutes to run.](media/devops-build-pipeline-12.png 'Monitor Build Pipeline')

3. Select **Job** to monitor the detailed status of the build pipeline execution.

    ![Monitor the details of your build pipeline.](media/devops-build-pipeline-13.png 'Monitor Build Pipeline Details')

### Task 3: Review Build Artifacts

1. The build will publish an artifact named `devops-for-ai`. Select **Artifacts, 1 published** to review the artifact contents.

    ![Select Artifacts, 1 published to review the artifact contents.](media/devops-build-pipeline-14.png 'Build Artifacts')

2. Select **outputs, eval_info.json**, and then select the download arrow. The `eval_info.json` is the output from the *model evaluation* step. The information from the evaluation step will be used in the release pipeline to deploy the model. Select the back arrow to return to the previous screen.

    ![Download output from the model evaluation step.](media/devops-build-pipeline-15.png 'Download JSON file')

3. Open the `eval_info.json` in a json viewer or a text editor and observe the information. The json output contains information such as if the model passed the evaluation step (`deploy_model`: *true or false*), and the name and id of the created image (`image_name` and `image_id`) to deploy.

    ![Review information in the eval_info json file.](media/devops-build-pipeline-16.png 'Eval Info JSON File')

### Task 4: Review Build Outputs

1. Log in to [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com) either directly or via the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com). Make sure you select the Azure Machine Learning workspace that you created from the notebook earlier. Open your **Models** section, and observe the versions of the registered model: `compliance-classifier`. The latest version is the one registered by the build pipeline you ran in the previous task.

    ![Review registered model in Azure Machine Learning studio.](media/devops-build-outputs-01.png 'Registered Models in Azure Machine Learning studio')

2. Select the latest version of your model to review its properties. The ```build_number``` tag links the registered model to the Azure DevOps build that generated it.

    ![Review registered model properties, notice Build_Number tag.](!media/../media/devops-build-outputs-02.png 'Registered model details and Build_Number tag')

3. Open your **Datasets** section and observe the versions of the registered dataset: ```connected_car_components```. The latest version is the one registered by the build pipeline you have run in the previous task.

    ![Review registered dataset in Azure Machine Learning studio.](media/devops-build-outputs-03.png 'Registered Datasets in Azure Machine Learning studio')

4. Select the latest version of your dataset to review its properties. Notice the ```build_number``` tag that links the dataset version to the Azure DevOps build that generated it.

3. Log in to Azure Machine Learning studio. Open your **Endpoints** section, and observe the deployed webservice: **compliance-classifier-service**.

    ![View deployed webservice in Azure Machine Learning studio.](media/devops-test-pipelines-08.png 'Azure Machine Learning studio - Workspace, Deployments')

## Exercise 7: Testing the deployed solution

Duration: 15 minutes

In this exercise, you verify that the first release of the application works.

### Task 1: Test the Deployment

1. Browse to your Azure Notebooks project and navigate to `Test Deployment.ipynb`. This is the notebook you will step through executing in this lab.

2. Follow the instructions within the notebook to complete the lab.

3. Note that you will have to provide values for **Scoring URI** and **API Key** for the deployed webservice in the notebook.

## Exercise 8: Examining deployed model performance

Duration: 15 minutes

In this exercise, you learn how to monitor the performance of a deployed model.

### Task 1: Activate App Insights and data collection on the deployed model

1. Browse to your Azure Notebooks project and navigate to the [Model Telemetry](notebooks/Model%20Telemetry.ipynb) notebook. This is the notebook you will step through executing in this task.

2. Follow the instructions within the notebook to complete the task. When finished, your deployed model has now both [Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) integration and data collection activated.

3. Note that if there are errors (for example, `Too many requests for service compliance-classifier-service (overloaded)`) when you make calls against the deployed web service after your enable app insights (last cell in the `Model Telemetry` notebook), you should wait for 5 minutes and rerun the cell to make the calls.

### Task 2: Check Application Insights telemetry

1. Navigate to the Azure Portal and locate the resource group you created for this lab (the one where the Azure Machine Learning service workspace was created in).

2. Locate the Application Insights instance in the resource group and select it.

    ![Application Insights instance in resource group.](media/model-telemetry-01.png 'Resource Group Overview')

3. Go to **Overview**.

4. From the top row of the right section, select **Logs (Analytics)**. This will open the Application Insights query editor with an empty new query.

    ![From Application Insights Dashboard, select Logs to open the Query Editor.](media/model-telemetry-02.png 'Application Insights - Dashboard')

5. In the left pane, make sure the **Schema** tab is selected.

6. Hover over **requests** and select the icon on the right side - "Show sample records from this table".

    ![In Application Insights create requests query.](media/model-telemetry-03.png 'Create Requests Query')

7. Look at the results displayed. Application Insights is tracing all requests made to your model. Sometimes, a couple of minutes are needed for the telemetry information to propagate. If there are no results displayed, wait a minute. Call your model wait a minute and select **Run** to re-execute the Application Insights query.

   ![In Application Insights observe requests query results.](media/model-telemetry-04.png 'Requests Query Results')

*Note that if you do not see telemetry information after selecting **Run** to re-execute the Application insights query. Please rerun the last cell in the `Model Telemetry` notebook a few more times to generate more data. Then select **Run** on this page to re-execute the Application insights query.*

### Task 3: Check the data collected

1. Navigate to the Azure Portal and locate the resource group you created for this lab (the one where the Azure Machine Learning service workspace was created in).
2. Locate the Storage Account instance in the resource group and select it.

    ![From the Resource Group Overview locate the Telemetry Storage account](media/model-telemetry-05.png 'Resource Group Overview')

3. Go to **Storage Explorer (preview)**.

4. Expand the **BLOB CONTAINERS** section and identify the **modeldata** container. Select **More->Refresh** if you do not see **modeldata** container.

    ![Locate the telemetry blob container in the storage account.](media/model-telemetry-06.png 'Storage Explorer')

5. Identify the CSV files containing the collected data. The path to the output blobs is based on the following structure:

    `modeldata -> subscriptionid -> resourcegroup -> workspace -> webservice -> model -> version -> identifier -> year -> month -> day -> data.csv`

    ![Locate telemetry data in the blob container.](media/model-telemetry-07.png 'Storage Explorer - data.csv')

## After the hands-on lab

Duration: 5 minutes

To avoid unexpected charges, it is recommended that you clean up all of your lab resources when you complete the lab.

### Task 1: Clean up lab resources

1. Navigate to the Azure Portal and locate the resource group you created for this lab (the one where the Azure Machine Learning service workspace was created in).

2. Select **Delete resource group** from the command bar.

    ![Screenshot of the Delete resource group button.](media/cleanup-01.png 'Delete resource group button')

3. In the confirmation dialog that appears, enter the name of the resource group and select **Delete**.

4. Wait for the confirmation that the Resource Group has been successfully deleted. If you don't wait, and the delete fails for some reason, you may be left with resources running that were not expected. You can monitor using the Notifications dialog, which is accessible from the Alarm icon.

    ![The Notifications dialog box has a message stating that the resource group is being deleted.](media/cleanup-02.png 'Delete Resource Group Notification Dialog')

5. When the Notification indicates success, the cleanup is complete.

    ![The Notifications dialog box has a message stating that the resource group has been deleted.](media/cleanup-03.png 'Delete Resource Group Notification Dialog')

You should follow all steps provided _after_ attending the Hands-on lab.
