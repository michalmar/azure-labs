# MLOps before the hands-on lab setup guide

## Requirements

1. Azure subscription. You will need a valid and active Azure account to complete the quickstarts. If you do not have one, you can sign up for a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).

   - The Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.

   - Trial subscriptions will not work. You will run into issues with Azure resource quota limits.

   - Subscriptions with access limited to a single resource group will not work. You will need the ability to deploy multiple resource groups.

2. Azure DevOps subscription. You will need a valid and active Azure DevOps account to complete the quickstarts. If you do not have one, you can sign up for a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/).

   >**Note**: You will need privileges to create projects on the DevOps account. Also, you need privileges to create Service Principal in the tenet. This translates to `Ensure that the user has 'Owner' or 'User Access Administrator' permissions on the Subscription`.

3. Azure Notebooks. You will need an Azure Notebooks project to import the quickstart notebooks into. See instructions below on how to prepare your Azure Notebooks environment.

4. Azure Machine Learning service workspace. The workspace is created during Exercise 1 from the hands-on lab.

   >**Note**: Make sure you execute successfully all steps related to the Azure Machine Learning service workspace setup in Exercise 1. A correctly set up workspace is needed by all the other exercises.

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 5 minutes

At a high level, here are the setup tasks you will need to perform to prepare your Azure Notebooks Environment (the detailed instructions follow):

5. Once the import is complete, a new project named ```mcw-mlops``` is available in your account. All the notebooks mentioned in the hands-on lab are available in the following location: ```\Hands-on Lab\notebooks```.

### Task 3: Start the Notebook server

1. Navigate to your project: ```mcw-mlops```.

2. Start your Notebook server on **Free Compute** by selecting the **Play** icon in the toolbar as shown:
